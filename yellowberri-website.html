      <p>A few things I'm proud of in the Yellowberri 3.0 website.</p>

      <p>I didn't know it had fireworks! I told my wife, she was very supportive.</p>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        At Yellowberri I worked with WordPress a lot, and was lucky enough to find Advanced Custom Fields early on.
        We primarily worked on information based (brochure) websites for small to medium sized businesses.
      </p>

      <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
      <p>
        I learned an immeasurble amount during that time, especially about what kind of websites get updated, and those that don't.
        That's worth a whole other post. But anyways, I aimed to make a new Yellowberri website that was, in order:
      </p>

      <ul class="gap-bottom">
        <li>going to recieve updates</li>
        <li>fast</li>
        <li>flashy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I think is neat</h2>

      <h3>WordPress Backend</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        WordPress + ACF, in my opinion provides an unequaled backend CMS experience for users whose primary occupation is not updating websites.
        Many website maintainers are familiar with WordPress in advance even!
      </p>

      <h3>Static Compatible</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        While not currently deployed as such, the 3.0 site can be turned into a static site with a simple wget + find and replace.
        The site utilizes Formspree for simple contact forms with no additional Javascript.
      </p>

      <h3>Prepared for Social Media</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        Small standalone websites mean nothing without distribution. I've found one the killer app of on-site blog posts is control over Open Graph images and titles for distribution on social channels. 
        The CMS experience is a Pass/Fail test for utilization, so using intuitive tools and defaults is a must.
      </p>

      <h3>Solid Lighthouse Scores</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        On launch scores, were pinned at 100 across the board! I was very happy to have achieved that in a live production site.
        After install third party scripts the score dropped a few points, but still firmly in the green.
      </p>

      <h3>Lottie / Bodymovin Integration</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        Built from the start to support inline SVG and Bodymovin animations, the 3.0 sites support updating animations via the WordPress backend.
      </p>

      <h3>Page Animations</h3>
      <p class="gap-bottom">
        While admittedly a bit flashy, I think it's okay for an advertising site. The JS splits a Bodymovin animation by frames and randomizes the entry and exit.
        Featuring page replacement AJAX to allow for page transitions between server rendered pages.
      </p>

      <h2>Best part</h2>
      <p class="gap-bottom">It's getting used! It took a long time to get launched but I'm glad it's out for now :)</p>
